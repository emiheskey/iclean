                <p> An obvious case to use iClean is where you have no regular domestic cleaner (or haven't had one for a while) and things are starting to get real in your living space. There are new species of fungi growing on your dirty dishes, and your bedding is used to hide the sheets in addition to covering you up.

In this case, enter the particulars of your place as well as additional tasks that need to be done, and schedule a once off clean for a time that suits you. Seeing as you let things get that bad, maybe consider a weekly or once-every-two-weeks clean?</p>

                <p> While many Nigerians have some form of assistance with domestic cleaning, there are those who are valiant enough to do it all themselves. In this case, you may want a professional cleaner to give the place a deeper clean, doing things like dusting and vacuuming as well as the extras like wiping down walls, oven cleans, fridge cleans and window cleans.

In this case, select the amount of rooms you would like cleaned as well as all of the extra tasks that you may not have paid attention to and want done. Observe the hours needed and adjust if necessary. This option can also be used for cases where only a spring clean is needed.</p>

In this case, select the number of rooms to be cleaned as well as additional tasks to be done. If there is a lot of cleaning needed, you may want to use two cleaners. The iClean platform may select two cleaners for bookings longer than 9 hours.</p>

              <div class="faq-box-answer">
                <p> If you are having an event and need a cleaner present either during the event or to clean up afterwards, iClean is here to help.

While booking, click on the during/after party button and select the amount of hours required for the clean. Input the address and payment information and then after the process is complete, use "other" under "additional information" to open up a dialogue box telling us that you are specifically booking a cleaner for an event. Alternatively, email us directly at hello@iclean.com.ng and we will set up the booking for you.</p>
